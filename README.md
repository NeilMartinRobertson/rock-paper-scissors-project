# Project Reflections

In this project I have reinforced various elements that I have been learning
Through it, I put in practice the strengths of conditionals in how they can be used together to create a simple game

The value of using increments in combination with other elements to display their strengths

How to use the DOM to create an interactive simple user interface 

Refactoring code after learning new elements to make the code more concise and easier to use

Taking the problem and not tackling it straight away but instead working on how you will solve it

# What I was good at

I felt very confident about using conditionals with me getting better at chaining them together

Using increments and decrements to create counters to work with

# What I am still not that confident in

I got better at using event listeners and creating relationships with the DOM but I still need to work on it which I will use my next project to get better at that

Being able to clearly display the problem and the algorithm to solve it is still a struggle for me which I need to improve on

# Conclusion

I really liked this project in taking my existing knowledge and creating something from it while it being fun to do and reinforcing what I have been learning to do. It was great seeing code that I was writing out display results in the web browser from the console and then adding it from the UI elements in creating that to be interactive from the user while cutting down on code.
